Hashing			 	"Map to search, insert and delete in O(1) time. Reduces complexity"

					"Retrieves value using index from key w/o search"

Map					"data structure store entry "
					* key "search key"
					* value
			
Hash function		"Maps key to index in hash table"

Hash table			"Array stores values"

Hash code			"Hash function converts key to integer value"

					*compress hash code into index in hash table
				
Collision handling	"Handles two keys w/ same hash code"

Perfect hashing		"Hash function does not lead top collisions"
